## Growth Mindset 

#### What does it mean to have a growth mindset ? 

  Having a growth mindset isn't about always thinking positively. It is about _how you react_ when aren't easy
  Often you will be faced with things like  obstacles, criticism, and Challenges. For example, if you have a mountian of dishes to do after a long day of work what is your mind telling you to do. 
  It could go one of two ways. 
  1. You tackle the dishes head on
  2. You avoid the dishes 
 
  If you picked number 1 then you may understand that putting in effort to a big task is far more rewarding than dealing with the regret of looking at the mountian for another 2-3 days. 
  The reward of tackling a task that you doubted ***yourself*** on completing outweighs the disgusting feeling of gulit everyday of the week. 
  This may be a <sub>small</sub> example or a no brainer for some but for myself its a real life example that I struggle with. 
  I always that a growth mindset was about thinking postiviely and making plans.
  **BUT** Thats not it its more about the actions when the event pop up than anything else. 
  
  When I think about of picking choices like number 2 I force myself to think about why I can't. 
  And when I think about those reasons it's a no brainer for me. 
  
  #### My reasons pick the hard choice until its *not* hard

  My son needs a better life. I want him to have all of the opportunities that I didn't have. If my parents had the means to do the things I am doing now i'm sure they would have done it. 
  Which actually brings me to my next reason. . 
  
  2. My old people ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123973263/215563655-09a3dd66-de15-4224-83fd-997deada7d0e.png)
  Charlestta and Billy Carter brought me in the world in the 90's and gave me all they had. Before anything happens to them in this world I just wanna make them **extremely** proud. I wanna show them all that I can accomplish while I can. But I don't just have them pushing me 
  
  3. Last but not least Me and My crew ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123973263/215565189-9c4d10d0-b36d-4f91-bce5-d3117710145c.png)
  These are my girls we've known each other since highschool and they have always had my back. This year we have all been making moves to evaluate ourselves. Whether the steps are becoming a MUA, finishing a self written book, or joining a intense coding bootcamp we are **all** making steps. We hold each other accountable because we know the life we want to live in the near future.
  
  Overall I'm pushing myself to complete this stage in my life on a positive note. I'm always open to adding wonderful driven people to my circle so please reach. I'm friendly :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
